# Temps-In-Map

This project comprises frontend (React) (`/frontend`) and backend (Nodejs, Express) (`/backend`). Both are independent projects and can be run separately.

## Instructions

You need to have basic JS development environment, `docker` and `docker-compose`.

Create `.env` file to the root directory (this one) and add the same environment variables as shown in `example.env` file.

```sh
docker-compose up
```
